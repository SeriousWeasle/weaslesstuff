About this project:
This doom mod is made by me as time goes by. Everytime I get an idea or someone suggests something I will probably implement it
and tweak the added items while working on new stuff.

The project is primarily written in DECORATE and a small portion is written in ACS. The ACS source files are included in ./pk3/ACS/source/.

I mostly work on this project at night or during breaks at school, or when I have some spare time and a concept to implement.

Feel free to copy code and/or sprites from this project, just credit me in a way, you do not need permission or anything.
