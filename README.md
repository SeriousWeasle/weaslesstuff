About this project:
This doom mod is made by me as time goes by. Everytime I get an idea or someone suggests something I will probably implement it
and tweak the added items while working on new stuff.

The project is primarily written in DECORATE and a small portion is written in ACS. The ACS source files are included in ./pk3/ACS/source/.

I mostly work on this project at night or during breaks at school, or when I have some spare time and a concept to implement.

Feel free to copy code and/or sprites from this project, just credit me in a way or copy the part of the credits applying to the resource I used, you do not need permission or anything from me.

If one of the sprites and/or sounds I used in the project belongs to you and don't want me to use it or use it in the way I currently am, report it as an issue tagged "Stop using my resources" and I will look into it.
